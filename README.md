This is a collection of Tyr tutorials.

If you are new to Tyr, there is a [Hello World tutorial](https://github.com/tyr-lang/tutorials/tree/master/beginner/HelloWorld) starting a beginner-oriented series.
If you are experienced in C++, C, Ada, Rust or similar, there is a [programmering experts cheat sheet](https://github.com/tyr-lang/tutorials/blob/master/ForProgrammingExperts.md) for Tyr.
Each tutorial comes with an executable Tyr project.

Tutorials are grouped into:
- [beginner](https://github.com/tyr-lang/tutorials/tree/master/beginner): Explaining the core concepts that every programmer has to master eventually
- [advanced](https://github.com/tyr-lang/tutorials/tree/master/advanced): Explaining concepts that library developers should master eventually
- [expert](https://github.com/tyr-lang/tutorials/tree/master/expert): Explaining concepts that are only relevant in specific use cases


## Contributing to Tutorials

Any feedback and contribution is welcome!
A tutorial should focus on a single concept.
Also, it should contain an executable project explaining the excerpts used in the text.
Tutorial project names should be unique and start with "tutorial.".

Always taking the first suggested next tutorial should result in a reader reading all tutorials at least for beginner.
